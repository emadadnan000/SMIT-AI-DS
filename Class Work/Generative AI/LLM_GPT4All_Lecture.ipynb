This property is harnessed through operations like Hadamard gates that put a single qubit into an equal probability state representing |0⟩ and |1⟩ at once. The interference between these states enables complex computations with fewer steps than classical bits, which can only be 0 or 1 at any given time.\n",

One such code is the Shor Code, which encodes a single logical qubit into nine physical qubits. It can correct arbitrary single-qubit errors by applying specific quantum gates and measurements without collapsing the overall state of the system.\n",
